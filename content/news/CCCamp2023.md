## Talk: Resilient Communication during Blackouts & Internet Shutdowns

 This talk will give some insights into user stories, features, and development of the Internet independent messenger qaul. qaul was developed with communities that cannot use Internet-based communication platforms due to Internet shutdowns, lack of connectivity and poor infrastructure, or due to surveillance and censorship. Resilient grassroots communication infrastructures - such as community wireless meshnetworks - need applications and protocols to realize their potential. qaul is particularly suited for this, and also provides concepts for user discovery within networks and areas. All communication is P2P and encrypted. The qaul routing protocol meshes devices together and even enables delay tolerant messaging. The use shall be as easy, user friendly and secure as with the well known Internet-based messengers.

* **When:** 16 August 2023
* **Where:** Bits & Bäume stage
