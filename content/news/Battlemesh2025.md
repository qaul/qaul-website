# Meet qaul @ Wireless Battlemesh

Meet us at the [Wireless Battlemesh v17](https://battlemesh.org/BattleMeshV17), an annual convention with talks and workshops on technical and political issues related to mesh networking and wireless community networks.

At the battle mesh we will test and develop qaul, with a focus on the interoperability of qaul and Wireless Community Network distributions and routing protocols. The local Community Network over wifi and fiber will provide an excellent testbed.

In parallel the 'OpenWRT Summit' will take place at the Battlemesh as well.

10-16 June 2025, Sundhausen, Germany{{<br>}}
