# Google Summer of Code Program 2025

qaul is again part of the Google Summer of Code program in 2025.
From many applications, [Mohit AKA Claddy](https://github.com/mohitk108) was selected to implement an authentication layer for the UI to libqaul communication.

Follow Mohit's experience during this coding endeavour via the [Blog Posts](https://blog.freifunk.net/author/claddyy/)

The created feature can be tracked on github [issue #531: libqaul <-> UI protobuf RPC authentication](https://github.com/qaul/qaul.net/issues/531).
