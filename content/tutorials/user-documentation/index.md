No matter how you are connected, via Wifi, Bluetooth, or even via the Internet. All devices are interlinked and can send messages to users currently connected.

When a user is not connected, other devices can store the encrypted messages and deliver it as soon as this user gets online.

## Security & Privacy

qaul.net protects your privacy. All data is stored locally on your device, your qaul identity does not contain any personal information.

All connections between devices are encrypted. Outsiders who are not part of the network, cannot decrypt the traffic.

Your qaul ID number stays with you until you delete the app. It is directly linked to your cryptographic key. Every message you write is cryptographically signed, for that nobody can write a message in your name or fake your identity.

All chat messages are end to end encrypted, which ensures that only you and the person you write the message to can read the messages.
